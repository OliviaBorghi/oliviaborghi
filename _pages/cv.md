 Research
I am interested in higher category theory, homotopy theory and operads. My current program offers a generalization
of symmetric notions in higher monoidal categories and operads. Specifically I have developed
notions of G-monoidal ∞-categories, and ∞-G-operads which extend the notions of symmetric equivariance
to a larger array of groups called ”action operads” in a way that corroborates the extent literature on symmetric
monoidal∞-categories and∞-operads.
In mathematics, collaborators are listed in alphabetical order and are considered equal contributors.

Teichmüller theory. To appear in the proceedings of the CRM Workshop on Higher Structures and Operadic
Calculus. arXiv:2210.13640v2
