Welcome to my academic website.  My name is Olivia Borghi.  I am a pure mathematician focusing in abstract homotopy theory.  My PhD thesis is titled Commutativity in Higher Algebraic Objects.  It deals primarily with the notion of a commutativity in algebraic objects that is governed by general groups.  The primary results of my thesis are a model structure on the category of G-operads, a novel definition for G-monoidal categories as discrete 2-opfibrations over the 2-category of G-operators, a definition for G-monoidal infinity categories, and a novel definition G-infinity-operads both as certain types of fibrations of an action infinity operad.  On this site you can find my CV and publications as well as a detailing of my teaching and subject development experience.
